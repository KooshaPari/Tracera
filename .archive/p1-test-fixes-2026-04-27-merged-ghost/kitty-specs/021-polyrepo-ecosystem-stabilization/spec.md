# Polyrepo Ecosystem Stabilization & Optimization

## Meta

- **ID**: 021-polyrepo-ecosystem-stabilization
- **Title**: Full 247-Repo Ecosystem Audit, Stabilization, and Optimization
- **Created**: 2026-04-02
- **State**: specified
- **Scope**: Shelf-level (cross-repo, all 247 repos)
- **Priority**: P0 — Critical
- **Depends On**: 012-github-portfolio-triage, 013-phenotype-infrakit-stabilization, eco-001-worktree-remediation, eco-002-branch-consolidation

## Context

The Phenotype ecosystem has exploded to **247 repositories** across the KooshaPari GitHub organization. Only **9 repos are cloned locally** consuming **89 GB** (22 GB in build artifacts alone). The ecosystem spans 15+ languages with 65 Rust, 45 Python, 30 TypeScript, and 25 Go repos.

This growth was organic and rapid (~100 repos created in March 2026 alone) without systematic governance, resulting in:
- **Fragmented state**: 7 of 9 local repos have uncommitted changes, 10 open PRs in phenotype-infrakit alone
- **Stale artifacts**: 22 GB in build artifacts, 50+ stale branches, empty worktree directories
- **Incomplete specs**: AgilePlus has 35 specs, many with only `spec.md` files (no plans, tasks, or research)
- **Missing infrastructure**: No org-level CI/CD, no package publishing, no docs federation
- **Off-main repos**: thegent, heliosApp, heliosCLI canonical repos are NOT on `main`
- **Disk crisis**: 89 GB local, dominated by heliosCLI (39 GB bazel) and AgilePlus (20 GB venv)

This spec orchestrates a **4-phase stabilization plan** targeting full ecosystem governance within one quarter, reducing from 247 to ~190 managed repos while establishing durable infrastructure.

## Problem Statement

1. **247 repos unmanageable**: No grouping strategy, no clear ownership signals, no systematic governance
2. **Local state degraded**: 89 GB disk, 7/9 repos dirty, worktrees in disarray
3. **AgilePlus incomplete**: 35 specs, ~15 with only spec.md, worklog 29 days stale
4. **No shared infrastructure**: CI/CD not distributed, no package registry, no docs federation
5. **Agent context loss**: 247 repos overwhelm agent context windows, agents struggle with breadth
6. **In-progress work orphaned**: 50+ tasks across repos at various completion states, no tracking

## Goals

- Group all 247 repos into **6 logical clusters** for manageable stabilization
- Reduce portfolio to **~190 repos** through archival, consolidation, and merging
- Reduce local disk from **89 GB → 20 GB** (77% reduction)
- Complete **all open PRs** across 9 cloned repos (10 in infrakit, 5 in thegent, etc.)
- Enrich **all incomplete AgilePlus specs** with plans, tasks, and research
- Establish **org-level CI/CD** with reusable workflows
- Set up **package publishing** for npm, PyPI, crates.io, Go modules
- Create **docs federation** hub at docs.phenotype.dev
- Return **all canonical repos to main** branch
- Establish **worktree discipline** with documented rules

## Non-Goals

- Rewriting any core application logic
- Migrating repos to different languages
- Creating new features (stabilization only)
- Deleting any repository (archive only, preserve history on git)
